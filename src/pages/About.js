                    Hey there, my name is Jake! I am an experienced fullstack developer
                    who graduated from University of Arizona's Full Stack Web
                    Development Bootcamp. I have worked on a multitude of projects varying from 
                    simple weather applications to visualizing data from COVID-19 in the US
                    and creating a self hosted GitHub "clone". I love technology and 
                    the process of problem solving. In addition to my love for developing applications
                    I am also a musician and love finding ways of marrying my two passions
                    using things like Max/MSP and modular synthesizers. Whether you want to talk about your
                    development needs or the new Thundercat album, I'd love to hear from you and look forward
                    to building a relationship!
